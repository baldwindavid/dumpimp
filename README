========

Rake tasks to dump and import various database batch files. (currently only MySQL, but feel free to add additional)

  db:dump
  =====================
  Description: Dump database file and gzip for RAILS_ENV.  Initial path of dump is to "db/".  Set alternate path with INITIAL_PATH=path/to/dump/.  To skip gzip use GZIP=no.
  
  Options:
    INITIAL_PATH=/my/db/dump/path/  (defaults to db/)
    GZIP=yes|no (defaults to yes)
    RAILS_ENV=production|development|test (default is development)

  Examples:
    rake db:dump
      - dumps development database to file in db/ folder
      - then gzips the file so you're left with "env_database_name_dump.sql.gz"
  
    rake db:dump INITIAL_PATH=.
      - same as above except dumps into root of your application instead of db/
  
    rake db:dump GZIP=no RAILS_ENV=production
      - dumps production database to sql file in db/ folder
      - does not gzip the file

  

  db:import
  =====================
  Description: Import database dump file into the specified RAILS_ENV.  Select file with FILE=path/to/file.  If the file is gzipped, it will be unzipped, imported and then gzipped back again.

  Requirements:
    FILE=path/to/file
  
  Options:
    RAILS_ENV=production|development|test - the environment database that the dump file is loaded into (defaults to development)

  Examples:
    rake db:import FILE=db/development_db_name_dump.sql.gz RAILS_ENV=production
      - first gunzips "development_db_name_dump.sql.gz"
      - then imports sql file into "production_db_name" database
      - finally gzips the file back up for the next usage
      
    rake db:import FILE=db/development_db_name_dump.sql RAILS_ENV=test
      - imports sql file into "test_db_name" database
      - no gunzip or gzip takes place unless given a .gz file
