Rake tasks to export from a MySQL db and gzip and then unzip and import into different Env database

NOTE: Both the dump and import can take a :mysql5 namespace rather than :mysql if necessary - My local environment only responds to mysql5 commands so I created this option


db:mysql:dump
=====================
Options:
  INITIAL_PATH=/my/db/dump/path/  (defaults to ~/dbdumps/)


  Examples:
  rake db:mysql:dump
    - dumps current environment's database to a sql file in ~/dbdumps folder
    - then gzips the file so you're left with "env_database_name.sql.gz"
    
  rake db:mysql:dump INITIAL_PATH=.
    - same as above except dumps into root of your application instead of ~/dbdumps/

  

db:mysql:import
=====================
Requirements:
  FROM=environment - the environment of the file that the database dump file is being loaded from
  RAILS_ENV=environment - the environment that the dump file is loaded to
Options:
  INITIAL_PATH=/my/db/dump/path/  (defaults to ~/dbdumps/)

  Examples:
    rake db:mysql:import FROM=development RAILS_ENV=production
      - first gunzips "FROM_environment_database_name.sql.gz" in ~/dbdumps/ folder
      - then imports sql file into "RAILS_ENV_database_name"
      - finally gzips the file back up for the next usage
    
    rake db:mysql:import FROM=development RAILS_ENV=production INITIAL_PATH=.
      - same as above except file is located in root of your app in this example rather than the default of ~/dbdumps/
